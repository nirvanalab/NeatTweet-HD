# Project 3 - *NeatTweet*

**NeatTweet** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x]	User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
  * [x] User can view more tweets as they scroll with [infinite pagination](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView). Number of tweets is unlimited.
    However there are [Twitter Api Rate Limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) in place.
* [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
* [ ] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.
* [ ] User can tap a tweet to **open a detailed tweet view**

* [x] [Leverage RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) as a replacement for the ListView and ArrayAdapter for all lists of tweets.
* [x] Move the "Compose" action to a [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Floating-Action-Buttons) instead of on the AppBar.
* [ ] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
